### Project Steps
#### Q1 State-wise Sales Overview: 
By creating a map visualization, I aim to showcase the total sales amounts for each state in the United States. This visualization will provide a comprehensive understanding of regional sales distribution across the country.

#### Q2 Shipping Mode Profitability Analysis: 
Exploring the relationship between shipping modes and profit margins, I've developed a visualization comparing the average profit margin for each shipping mode. This analysis will shed light on how different shipping methods impact profitability.

#### Q3 Sales Trend Analysis Over Time: 
Through a time series chart, I delve into the trend in sales each year, highlighting variations across different product categories. This visualization offers insights into evolving sales patterns over time.

#### Q4 Marketing Cost vs. Sales Correlation: 
Using a scatter plot with a trend line, I explore the correlation between marketing cost and sales. This visualization will help discern any underlying relationships between these two variables and their impact on overall sales performance.

#### Q5 Regional Sales Trends by Product Category: 
I've created a stacked bar chart to illustrate the distribution of sales among different product categories for each region. This visualization provides valuable insights into regional sales trends across various product categories, facilitating strategic decision-making.
